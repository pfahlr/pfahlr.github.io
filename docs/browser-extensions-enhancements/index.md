- **Violent Monkey**: Fork of **Grease Monkey**,  allows you to alter the javascript on a page. There's a lot you can do with that.

## Not extensions, but in the same category

- [**Betterfox**](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox): A bunch of reccommended optimizations for Firefox.
- [**Puppeteer**](https://pptr.dev/):Puppeteer is a JavaScript library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Firefox over the DevTools Protocol or WebDriver BiDi. Puppeteer runs in the headless (no visible UI) by default

[^1]:note: chrome store has disabled some useful extensions like ublock origin and violentmonkey... but, believe it or not, it's incredibly easy to bypass. Just follow these steps:

1. Right-Click->inspect on the **Add to Chrome** button to open the **Web Developer** panel

2. In the **Web Developer -> Elements** panel expand the container divs until you find the `<button>` element.

3. Select the **disabled** attribute on the **&lt;button&gt;** element and delete it. Then hit *enter* to apply your changes.
